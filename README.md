# shortly-express

## Description
Shortly is a URL shortener service similar to Bitly.
For this project, I build out an authentication system using and other features that enable users to have their own private set of shortened URLs.

## See it in action
Open your terminal and simply enter the commands below:
- git clone https://github.com/akcays/shortly
- cd shortly
- npm install
- npm start

Finally, enter localhost:4568/public on your browser.

## Technologies
Backbone.js on the client with a Node/Express-based server.
The server uses the Bookshelf.js ORM and EJS for templates.
Bcrypt for authentication.

It uses SQLite, a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

I used express 4 on server side, with libraries like jQuery, underscore.js and Backbone.js on client-side.

This repo includes some basic server specs using Mocha.


This is a project I completed at Hack Reactor.
